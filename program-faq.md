# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some frequently asked questions that may be useful.


- **Will I learn to develop applications on the Ethereum blockchain?**
    - No. This program is not focused on application development
    - No. This program is not focused on smart contract development
- **I'm not able to commit to "full time" (aka 40 hours a week).  Can I still apply?**
    - Yes. There are no hard restrictions on how many hours you must put towards the program.  The amount of time you will need to invest is going to depend on your current level of knowledge and what project you choose to pursue.  It will likely be difficult to be successful in the program if you are unable to commit at least 20 hours per week.
- **I don't know much about ______________.  Can I still apply?**
    - Yes. Applicants are expected to have gaps in their knowledge.  You should still read through the [program details](./program-details.md) to get a sense for what type of prior knowledge you should be working towards to be successful in the program.
- **What happens after the 4 months is complete?**
    - Assuming you are "successful" in the program we will work to continue "enabling" you to focus your effort on the protocol.  This could be continued "grant" style funding, helping you find a job on a team that's working on something interesting to you, or whatever it is that we can help with to keep you working with us.
If the program shows promise then we'll probably try to rope you into helping out with the next cohort.
- **Will funding be in ETH or Fiat?**
    - ETH or Fiat should both be available.
- **Will there be an interview process?**
    - No
- **How many applicants will be accepted in the second cohort?**
    - As many as 10 may be initially selected
    - Funding may be offered to participants who choose to participate independent of funding who are doing good work.
- **Can I still participate even if I am not selected in this cohort?**
    - Yes. Being "selected" into the program is really just the group that we'll be working directly with to provide funding.  The program is going to happen in the "open" meaning that anyone who wants to participate can be a part of the program on the same footing as those that are "selected".
