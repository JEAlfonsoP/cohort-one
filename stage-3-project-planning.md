In this stage you will create a plan for the execution of your project.

## Deliverable: Project Plan & Roadmap

The deliverable at this stage is a document outlining your plan for executing your project.  This document should contain a breakdown of the *things* you expect to be working on during the course of the project as well as a timeline for your projected execution of these items.
