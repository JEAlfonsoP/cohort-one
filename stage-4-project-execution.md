# Stage 4: Project Execution

Report: 

### (https://github.com/JEAlfonsoP/evm-tracing-comparison/blob/main/final%20draft.md)

It was only possible to run geth and nethermind archive nodes. For Besu, Open-Ethereum and Erigon further work is needed. With better resources a deeper comparison could be presented.

The main conclusion is that in fact there are differences between APIs access and results for both clients. Questions: Is this an efficiency decreasing factor to be considered and evaluated  ? Will these differences affect the merge for the different client combinations ?
